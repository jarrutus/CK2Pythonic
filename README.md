# CK2Pythonic
# Crusader Kings 2 mod, made by Zhatelier
#
# Includes a lot of references to the Monty Python an the Holy Grail movie as well as the legend of king Arthur.
# Adds in a Holy Grail event chain.
#
# Installing the mod:
# 1) Download the Pythonics folder and Pythonics.mod
# 2) Place them in your CK2 mod folder (Documents/Paradox_Interactive/Crusader_Kings_II/mod)
# 3) Launch CK2 and select Pythonics in the mod list.
#
# The mod may be combatible with other mods and custom worlds, however the event chain wont start unless you're a catholic.
# You can, however, kickstart the event chain via the console with: event Pythonic.001
# 
#
# Potential future plans (SPOILERS AHEAD):
#
# Things to add or change:
# - Actual way to find the Holy Grail & Holy grail as an artifact
# - Add the killer rabbit & Holy hand grenade of Antioch
# - Other flavour events
# - Character modifier for being on the hunt for the Holy Grail, visible to player
# - A decision to end the hunt after x number of years have passed
# - Possibly custom images for events
# - More letter events to diversify the mod assets
# - AI factors to the events so the AI can actually reliable go through the chain
# - Make dueling event(s) use weighted personal combat skill to determine probabilities
# - Make knights of the round table a formable society?
# - Have other in-game characters involved in the story
# - Balancing of various modifiers as well as frequency of the event chain appearing (requires extensive testing)
# - Potentially other things not mentioned here.
#
# At least initially, the mod will not be added to Steam Workshop, however, it might be put there later on.
# Localisations for other languages will probably not be added any time soon, since none of them I know well wnough to translate the events.
